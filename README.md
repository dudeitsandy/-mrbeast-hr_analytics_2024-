## Design Decisions & Business Rationale

### Technology Stack Selection

**PostgreSQL over SQLite:**
- **Scalability**: Handles concurrent analytical queries from multiple dashboard users
- **Data Types**: Native JSON support for future schema flexibility and complex HR data
- **Enterprise Ready**: ACID compliance and row-level security for production deployment
- **Analytics Performance**: Advanced indexing and query optimization for large datasets

**FastAPI over Flask/Django:**
- **Performance**: Async processing handles concurrent executive dashboard usage
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs reduce API maintenance overhead  
- **Validation**: Built-in Pydantic validation prevents data quality issues
- **Modern**: Type hints and async support align with current development best practices

**Streamlit over Custom Frontend:**
- **Rapid Development**: Focus time on business logic rather than frontend complexity
- **Executive-Friendly**: Clean, professional interface suitable for leadership presentations
- **Interactive Analytics**: Built-in filtering and drill-down capabilities
- **Low Maintenance**: Minimal frontend code reduces long-term maintenance burden

### Data Model & Business Logic

**Time-to-Hire Calculation Logic:**
- **Method**: Calendar days from application_date to hire_date
- **Business Rationale**: Simple metric that leadership can easily understand and benchmark against industry standards
- **Industry Context**: 30-40 days typical for most roles, 45-60 days for senior positions
- **Assumptions**: 
  - Weekend days included (reflects real hiring urgency and candidate experience)
  - Only completed applications (hired/rejected) used for conversion rates
  - NULL hire_dates excluded from calculations to prevent data skew

**Hire Rate Calculation Strategy:**
- **Method**: hired_count / (hired_count + rejected_count) - excludes in-flight candidates
- **Business Rationale**: True conversion rate of decision-complete applications
- **Industry Benchmarks**: 
  - Excellent (35%+): Highly effective screening and process
  - Good (20-34%): Strong candidate quality and process efficiency
  - Needs Improvement (<20%): Review screening criteria and interview process

**Department Analytics Approach:**
- **Role-Department Mapping**: Applicant "Role" field mapped to employee "Department" field using business logic
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing mappings by displaying "Unknown" with explanatory context
- **Business Focus**: Metrics grouped by organizational structure familiar to leadership

### API Design Philosophy

**Business-First Endpoint Design:**
- Endpoints structured around executive questions rather than database tables
- Response formats optimized for dashboard consumption and leadership reporting
- Error messages provide business context rather than technical details

**Scalability Architecture:**
- Connection pooling prevents database bottlenecks under concurrent usage
- Async processing enables multiple executive users simultaneously
- Stateless design allows horizontal scaling for organization growth

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Graceful degradation when data is incomplete (realistic for HR systems)
- Business-friendly error messages for non-technical users
- Comprehensive logging for operational debugging

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Optimized for analytical queries with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_applicants_status_dates ON hr_analytics.applicants ("Status", "Application Date", "hire_date");
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_department_salary ON hr_analytics.employees ("Department", "Salary");
```

**Normalization Strategy:**
- **3NF Design**: Reduces data redundancy while maintaining query performance
- **Composite Indexes**: Optimized for common business queries (department + date ranges)
- **View-Based Analytics**: Pre-computed views for expensive time-to-hire calculations
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging

### API Performance Optimization
```python
# Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
connection_pool = psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool(1, 10, ...)

# Async endpoints handle concurrent executive usage
@app.get("/hiring-metrics")
async def get_hiring_metrics():
```

**Performance Features:**
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy pool prevents connection exhaustion under load
- **Async Processing**: FastAPI async endpoints handle concurrent requests efficiently  
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed queries and result caching for frequently accessed metrics
- **Response Compression**: JSON compression for large dataset responses

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API design enables load balancing across multiple instances
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas for analytical queries, master for data loading
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration ready for frequently accessed department metrics
- **Monitoring Integration**: Structured logging enables APM integration for production monitoring

## Assumptions & Known Limitations

### Data Assumptions
- **Name Matching**: Applicants join to employees by exact name match (production would use employee ID or SSN)
- **Role-Department Mapping**: Applicant "Role" field semantically maps to employee "Department" field
- **Data Freshness**: Daily refresh assumed sufficient for HR analytics (not real-time dashboard needs)
- **Historical Scope**: 12-month rolling window provides sufficient trend analysis for business decisions
- **Status Definitions**: HR system status values are standardized and consistent across data sources

### Known Technical Limitations
- **Data Quality**: ~15% of applicants don't match to employees due to name variations and timing differences
- **Time-to-Hire Edge Cases**: Doesn't account for multiple offer rounds, negotiations, or start date delays
- **Scalability**: Current design optimized for ~10K records; would need partitioning for 100K+ records
- **Real-time Updates**: Daily batch processing doesn't reflect same-day hiring decisions
- **Complex Hierarchies**: Doesn't handle matrix reporting structures or temporary assignments

### Security Limitations (Demo Environment)
- **Authentication**: Demo uses basic auth; production requires SSO integration (Okta, Azure AD)
- **Authorization**: No role-based access control (CHRO vs. Department Manager permissions)
- **Data Encryption**: Demo doesn't encrypt PII data at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Limited audit trail for compliance requirements (SOX, GDPR)

### Production Considerations

**Real Implementation Would Include:**
- **ATS Integration**: Direct API connections to Greenhouse, Lever, Workday instead of file exports
- **Employee ID Joins**: Unique identifier-based joins instead of name matching
- **Data Lineage**: Complete audit trails for compliance and debugging
- **Advanced Analytics**: 
  - Predictive time-to-hire modeling
  - Candidate scoring algorithms  
  - Diversity and inclusion metrics
  - Compensation analysis integration
- **Enterprise Security**: SSO, encryption at rest, audit logging, role-based access
- **Performance Optimization**: Database partitioning, caching layers, CDN for dashboard assets

**Scalability Enhancements:**
- **Microservices**: Separate services for ETL, API, and analytics
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka/Pulsar for real-time data processing
- **Data Warehouse**: Separate OLAP system for complex analytics
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring
