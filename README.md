## Design Decisions & Business Rationale

### Technology Stack Selection

**PostgreSQL over SQLite:**
- **Scalability**: Handles concurrent analytical queries from multiple users
- **Data Types**: Better support for date/time operations critical for HR analytics
- **Production Ready**: ACID compliance and better error handling
- **Analytics Performance**: Advanced indexing for time-to-hire calculations

**FastAPI over Flask:**
- **Performance**: Async processing for concurrent dashboard usage
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs reduce maintenance
- **Validation**: Built-in request validation prevents data issues
- **Modern**: Type hints improve code maintainability

**Streamlit over Custom Frontend:**
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on business logic rather than frontend complexity
- **Executive-Friendly**: Professional interface suitable for leadership
- **Interactive**: Built-in filtering and visualization capabilities

### Data Model & Business Logic

**Time-to-Hire Calculation:**
- **Method**: Calendar days from application_date to hire_date
- **Business Rationale**: Simple metric that leadership can understand and track
- **Assumptions**: 
  - Weekend days included (reflects real hiring timeline)
  - Only completed applications (hired/rejected) used for conversion rates
  - NULL hire_dates excluded from calculations

**Hire Rate Calculation:**
- **Method**: hired_count / (hired_count + rejected_count) - excludes in-flight candidates
- **Business Rationale**: True conversion rate of completed applications
- **Provides**: More accurate measure of process efficiency than including pending applications

**Department Analytics:**
- **Role-Department Mapping**: Applicant "Role" field mapped to employee "Department" field
- **Handles Missing Data**: Gracefully manages applicants without matching employees
- **Business Focus**: Metrics grouped by organizational structure

### API Design Philosophy

**Business-First Endpoints:**
- Endpoints designed around common executive questions
- Response formats optimized for dashboard consumption
- Error messages provide context rather than technical details

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation when data is incomplete
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- HTTP status codes follow REST conventions

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Optimized for analytical queries
CREATE INDEX idx_applicants_status_dates ON hr_analytics.applicants ("Status", "Application Date");
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_department ON hr_analytics.employees ("Department");
```

**Key Features:**
- Normalized structure reduces data redundancy
- Composite indexes optimize common business queries
- Views pre-compute expensive time-to-hire calculations
- Constraints ensure data quality

### API Performance
```python
# Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
connection_pool = psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool(1, 10, ...)

# Async endpoints handle concurrent usage
@app.get("/hiring-metrics")
async def get_hiring_metrics():
```

**Performance Features:**
- Database connection pooling
- Async request processing
- Optimized SQL queries with proper indexing

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints (Required)
- **`GET /hiring-metrics`** - Time-to-hire analysis by department
- **`GET /applicants/status-summary`** - Pipeline status distribution

### Additional Endpoints
- **`GET /health`** - System health monitoring
- **`GET /master-employee-view`** - Employee data analysis
- **`GET /employment-types`** - Employment type distribution
- **`GET /department-analytics`** - Department performance metrics

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
hr_analytics.employees        -- Employee data with department and salary info
hr_analytics.applicants       -- Applicant pipeline data with status tracking
hr_analytics.employment_types -- Employment classification data
```

### Analytics Views
```sql
hr_analytics.time_to_hire_analysis    -- Pre-computed time-to-hire metrics
hr_analytics.department_analytics     -- Department performance summaries
hr_analytics.employment_type_analytics -- Workforce composition analysis
```

## Data Pipeline Architecture

### ETL Process
1. **Extract**: Load data from Excel files with validation
2. **Transform**: Clean and standardize data using business rules
3. **Load**: Insert into PostgreSQL with transaction safety
4. **Validate**: Post-load data quality checks

### Data Quality Features
```python
# Data validation includes:
- Date range validation (application_date <= hire_date)
- Department name standardization
- Status validation against known values
- Duplicate detection
- Missing value reporting
```

## Automation & Scheduling

### Cron Configuration
```bash
# Linux Production (2 AM daily)
0 2 * * * /path/to/scripts/daily_pipeline.sh >> /var/log/hr_pipeline.log 2>&1
```

### Windows Task Scheduler
```powershell
# Windows Development
schtasks /create /tn "MrBeast HR Pipeline" /tr "PowerShell.exe -File daily_automation.ps1" /sc daily /st 02:00
```

### Pipeline Operations
- **Data Validation**: Pre-flight checks ensure source data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- **Monitoring**: Pipeline execution tracking and health checks

## Assumptions & Known Limitations

### Data Assumptions
- **Name Matching**: Applicants join to employees by exact name match (production would use employee ID)
- **Role-Department Mapping**: Applicant "Role" field maps to employee "Department" field
- **Data Freshness**: Daily refresh assumed sufficient for HR analytics
- **Historical Scope**: Current implementation handles datasets up to ~10K records efficiently

### Technical Limitations
- **Data Quality**: Approximately 15% of applicants don't match to employees due to name variations
- **Authentication**: Basic HTTP authentication (production would require SSO integration)
- **Scalability**: Optimized for current dataset size; larger datasets would need partitioning
- **Real-time Updates**: Daily batch processing doesn't reflect same-day changes

### Production Considerations

**Real Implementation Would Include:**
- **ATS Integration**: Direct API connections to Greenhouse, Lever, Workday
- **Employee ID Joins**: Unique identifier-based joins instead of name matching
- **Advanced Security**: SSO integration, role-based access control, audit logging
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Predictive modeling, diversity metrics, compensation analysis
- **Enterprise Monitoring**: APM integration, alerting, performance metrics
